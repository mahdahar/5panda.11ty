# Architecture Overview

We have finalized the v1.0 architecture for the Clinical Laboratory Quality Management System (CLQMS). 

## Key Decisions

- **Event-Driven:** We are adopting an event-driven architecture for test result processing.
- **Micro-kernel:** The core system will remain small, with modules loaded as needed.

Next steps involve setting up the continuous integration pipeline.

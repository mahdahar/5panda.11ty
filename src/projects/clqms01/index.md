## 🏛️ Core Architecture & Design

The system is currently undergoing a strategic **Architectural Redesign** to consolidate legacy structures into a high-performance, maintainable schema. This design, spearheaded by leadership, focuses on reducing technical debt and improving data consistency across:

- **Unified Test Definitions:** Consolidating technical, calculated, and site-specific test data.
- **Reference Range Centralization:** A unified engine for numeric, threshold, text, and coded results.
- **Ordered Workflow Management:** Precise tracking of orders from collection to verification.

## 🛡️ Strategic Pillars

- **Precision & Accuracy:** Strict validation for all laboratory parameters and reference ranges.
- **Scalability:** Optimized for high-volume diagnostic environments.
- **Compliance:** Built-in audit trails and status history for full traceability.
- **Interoperability:** Modular architecture designed for LIS, HIS, and analyzer integrations.

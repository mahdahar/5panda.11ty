# CLQMS: Frontend Stack Decision

## Frontend Stack

After evaluating various frameworks including React and Vue, we have decided to proceed with **SvelteKit 5** for the frontend dashboard.

## Why SvelteKit 5?

- **Runes:** The new reactivity system simplifies state management significantly.
- **Performance:** Compile-time optimizations result in smaller bundles and faster hydration.
- **Developer Experience:** Less boilerplate and a more intuitive syntax.
- **DaisyUI + Tailwind CSS:** Seamless integration for our design system.
